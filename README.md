# Halloween Memory Game

This is a beginner-level memory card matching game with a Halloween theme for Hacktoberfest.

Feel free to contribute to the game! There's an issue I'm looking for help on, if you know how to make a pop-up that congratulates the player on matching all the cards, go for it! I'm also looking for a way to reload the game after congratulation the player and asking if they want to play again.
